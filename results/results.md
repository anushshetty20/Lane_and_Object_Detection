# Lane and Object Detection Results

## Overview
The lane and object detection system processes video input to identify lane markings and detect objects such as vehicles and pedestrians. The results are visualized by overlaying detected lanes and bounding boxes on the video frames.

## Lane Detection
- The system detects lane markings using image processing techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, and perspective transformation.
- Detected lane lines are highlighted on the processed video to provide a clear visualization of the road boundaries.
- The lane curvature is estimated to assist in determining the roadâ€™s direction.

## Object Detection
- The system employs a YOLOv8 model to detect objects in the video feed.
- Objects such as cars, pedestrians, and other road elements are identified and enclosed in bounding boxes.
- The model labels each detected object and assigns a confidence score for accuracy.

## Output Format
- The processed video output displays:
  - Detected lane markings in highlighted colors.
  - Bounding boxes around detected objects with labels.
- Example results are saved as images in the `results/` directory.
- The system can process both video files and real-time webcam input.

## Example Results
1. **Lane Detection Output**: Highlights lane lines detected in the video.
2. **Object Detection Output**: Shows bounding boxes around detected objects.
3. **Combined Output**: Displays both lane and object detection in a single frame.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve lane detection accuracy under different weather conditions.
- Enhance object detection capabilities to recognize additional road elements.
- Optimize real-time performance for embedded system deployment.

The generated results help in understanding the system's performance and evaluating its effectiveness in real-world driving scenarios.
